How to run program: 

javac CSVProcessor.java
javac Student.java
javac StudentManager.java
java StudentManager.java

No AI Use

Hurdles:

Formatting the main of the program so it looks nice was hard, I just had to go back and forth between compiling and running the program so the spaces and lines looked nice. For writing into the file I had to closely follow zybooks as well.
